## The Black-Scholes Model:\n
The Black-Scholes Model is a mathematical framework for pricing **European-style options**‚Äîthose that can **only be exercised at expiration**. 
Although it strictly applies to European options, it is still widely used for **American call options on non-dividend-paying stocks**, where early exercise isn‚Äôt optimal. 
For more complex situations (e.g., American puts or dividend-paying stocks), other models like **binomial trees**, **Monte Carlo simulations**, or the **Barone-Adesi‚ÄìWhaley model** may be more appropriate.

- **S**: Current price of the underlying stock

- Assumes constant volatility and interest rates  
- No arbitrage or transaction costs  
- Stock prices follow a log-normal distribution  
- The model outputs theoretical fair value, not necessarily market price  
- Greeks (Œî, Œì, Œò, Vega, Rho) measure sensitivities and are derived from these formulas
